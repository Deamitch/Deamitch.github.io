        <p>
          We have four main section: product idea, hurdles, structures, features, and social media.
          For product idea we out getting average metabolic data, getting nutrition values, uncluding warnings about certain allergen, dietary restrictions, supplements, etc; supplement ata for help with working out, research data for people to create their own informed decisions about working out and the supplements that should you take, and getting average calorie burns per workout.
          For hurdles we put credibility, differenceiability/getting people to use the app, and user engagement.
          For structures we put html, css javascript for languages; server based coding model to keep track of meal timing and nutrition even when the app is closed, figure out who's doing what and spreading work evenly, and design the app to be more simplistic but still stylish and unique.
          For features we put counts how many meals the user needs to eat over the day and plans their meals, calculate the needed calorie amount based on weight and activity, and gives multiple options for a meal plan, as in the amount of times needed to eat and the caloric value varies between options.
          For social media we put partnering with companys to offer rewards to consumers, rewards for using the app, getting engagement through smaller influencers and normal people over athletes, and subscription for certain features.

          <p>
            I want to create a nutrition app that will also take account of when you should eat and how much you should eat each meal. It will also take in calories burned and your goals for each day.
